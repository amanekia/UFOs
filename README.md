# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis
In this assignment we were tasked with creating a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a Javascript array or list. We also had to write code that would enable the user to filter the table for multiple criteria at the same time.  

## Results
After writing our code you can see the following table shows up in our HTML page.

Using this table you can filter your search according to the date, city, state, country and shape.
